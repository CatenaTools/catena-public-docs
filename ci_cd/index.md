# Catena CI/CD

## GitHub Actions

To develop Catena, the team leverages [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for automated testing and deployment of the Catena and packaging of the Unity SDK with each release.

The existing workflows are available in [catena-tools-core/.github/workflows](https://github.com/CatenaTools/catena-tools-core/tree/main/.github/workflows).

These are a great starting point for anyone customizing Catena deployments to pull in upstream source changes, layer in custom configs, container image creation, or perform custom integration tests.
