We provide two examples depending on your needs.

If you are interested in seeing Catena Matchmaking code in a Unity project that uses Netcode for GameObjects, refer to our [Catena Galactic Kittens Demo](https://github.com/CatenaTools/catena-GalacticKittens-demo). This demo extends Unity's Galactic Kittens Demo to utilize Catena Matchmaking. The [commit history for the "catena" branch](https://github.com/CatenaTools/catena-GalacticKittens-demo/commits/catena/) will show you the steps to add Catena Matchmaking to your Unity game.

Alternatively, if you either want a more bare bones reference or want a sample that utilizes [Mirror Networking](https://mirror-networking.com/), refer to the guide below.
