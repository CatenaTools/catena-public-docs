[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to develop, modify, and version infrastructure components. With it, we can deploy Catena to AWS in a handful of commands.

To install Terraform, refer to [their installation documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
