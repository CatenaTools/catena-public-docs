Full instructions for installing WSL can be found in [these official Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), but a condensed version can be found below.

1. Open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in **administrator** mode by right-clicking and selecting “Run as administrator”
2. Install WSL (We recommend using the **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** distro)

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

3. Restart your machine
