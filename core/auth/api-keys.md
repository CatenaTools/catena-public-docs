# API Keys

API keys are typically used to authorize services instead of users and exist until they are revoked. An API key is
created with a policy - a set of permissions that are granted to that API key.

## Requiring an API key

A service RPC method can require an API key by utilizing the `AuthRequired` attribute with a set of permissions. When a service RPC
requiring an API key is called, the Catena node will first look at the permissions of this attribute and compare each to
the policy applied to the API key sent with the request. The RPC method will only be called if at least one required
permission is in the policy.

When the `AuthRequired` attribute is used with an empty permission set, then any valid API key will
be accepted regardless of policies or permissions. This can be useful for a test method or simple implementations.

Example requiring _any_ API key:

```C#
[AuthRequired([])]
public override Task<TestApiKeyResponse> TestApiKey(
    TestApiKeyRequest request,
    ServerCallContext context
)
```

Example requiring an API key whose policy includes the `super-secure` permission:

```C#
[AuthRequired(["super-secure"])]
public override Task<SuperSecureThingResponse> SuperSecureThing(
    TestApiKeyRequest request,
    ServerCallContext context
)
```

Example requiring an API key whose policy includes either the `pretty-secure` permission or the `super-secure`
permission (or both):

```C#
[AuthRequired(["pretty-secure", "super-secure"])]
public override Task<SuperSecureThingResponse> SuperSecureThing(
    TestApiKeyRequest request,
    ServerCallContext context
)
```

## Defining a permission

Defining a permission on a service is done with the `UsesTrustedServerPermission` attribute on the service class
including a name and a description. This forward declaration allows Catena to check that defined permissions are
actually used, that no undefined permissions are required, and that permissions have a description. This is done to
improve policy management and avoid mistakes that could lead to vulnerability.

The name of the permission can be used in subsequent `AuthRequired` attributes within the service. The description will
be utilized by anything that manages API keys/policies.

```C# {% title="Permission declaration example" %}
[UsesTrustedServerPermission("delete_account", "Permits deleting existing accounts.")]
public class AccountsService() {
    [AuthRequired("delete_account")]
    public override Task<DeleteAccountResponse> DeleteAccount(
        DeleteAccountRequest request,
        ServerCallContext context
    )
}
```

A service may define as many permissions as it uses. Permissions are scoped to the service so there is no concern with
duplicating the permission of another service.

Typically, a service managing API keys, such as the CatenaApiKeysService, will collect all the available permissions
which can then be used to build policies that are applied to API keys.
